# Check Point API Exporter - Bridged API Gaps

This document lists features that were previously unsupported by the standard API show commands or Ansible modules, but have been added to this exporter.

## Access Layer Default Rule Property
- **Feature**: add-default-rule
- **Version Added**: API 1.1 (R80.10)
- **Description**: Standard show-access-layers commands often omit this property. The exporter now explicitly whitelists and parses this field to determine if a layer has an auto-generated cleanup rule.

## Default Cleanup Rule Management
- **Feature**: Automatic set vs add logic for Cleanup rules
- **Version Added**: Script Logic for R80.40 and above
- **Description**: Resolved the conflict where auto-generated cleanup rules caused import failures. The exporter now detects existing default rules and uses the set command to enforce track Log, while using add for custom cleanup rules.

## TCP Service Sync Parameters
- **Feature**: delayed-sync-value, enable-tcp-resource, use-delayed-sync
- **Version Added**: API 1.0 (R80)
- **Description**: These advanced synchronization fields were previously missing from static export lists. They are now dynamically discovered and supported for R80.10 and later management servers.

## VPN Shared Secret Nesting
- **Feature**: Nested shared-secrets structure
- **Version Added**: API 1.6 (R80.40)
- **Description**: Standard API responses often provide shared secrets in a format incompatible with direct CLI adds. The exporter correctly nests these within the shared-secrets list for each gateway to ensure successful CLI import.

## Network Topology Filter
- **Feature**: Case-sensitive auto-gen pattern matching
- **Version Added**: Script Logic for R81 and above
- **Description**: Implemented precise filtering to distinguish between system-managed Net_X.X.X.X objects and user-created net_... objects, preventing accidental exclusion of critical network definitions.
