# Check Point API Exporter - Current Limitations

This list reflects remaining constraints and gaps when exporting policies across Check Point versions R80.40 through R82.

## Object Constraints
- **Application Control**: The application-site object may miss the primary-category field in environments running R80.x (API 1.6) due to API spec visibility constraints. This was significantly improved in API v1.7 (R81) and later versions, where the field is consistently available in show-objects output.
- **Field Whitelisting**: Certain complex objects (access-role, simple-gateway, vpn-community-meshed, vpn-community-star) are exported with a curated list of fields to ensure import stability across API versions from 1.6 to 2.x.
- **Ansible Mappings**: The Management API uses remote-access-client (singular), whereas Ansible modules (notably in R81.x) typically expect remote-access-clients (plural).

## Access Rule Limitations
- **Advanced Parameters**: The vpn and content (Content Awareness) settings are currently excluded from the export tasks.
- **Ansible Rule Names**: Using the name "Management" for an access rule can cause execution failures when using the cp_mgmt_access_rule Ansible module.
- **Updatable Objects**: Rules referencing objects such as "Office365 Services" require the target Management server (R80.40+) to have an active internet connection and an updated updatable objects database.

## Implementation Best Practices
- **Sequential Import**: When using Ansible, use loops to import tasks in order to prevent dependency errors.
- **CLI Import Robustness**: For large-scale policies on R82 (API 2.x), use the generated import_mgmt_cli.txt file for the most reliable import experience, as it bypasses Ansible module overhead.
