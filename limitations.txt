# Check Point API Exporter - Ecosystem Constraints

This document lists intrinsic constraints and environmental requirements that persist regardless of the Management API version in use (including R81.x and R82).

## Ansible Module Mappings
- **Naming Mismatch**: The Check Point Management API uses singular types (e.g., remote-access-client), whereas the official Ansible modules expect plural names (e.g., remote-access-clients). This requires manual mapping in automation playbooks.

## Reserved Object and Rule Names
- **Management Conflict**: Using the name "Management" for an access rule or object can cause execution failures within the `cp_mgmt_access_rule` Ansible module due to internal reserved-word logic.

## Environmental Requirements
- **Updatable Objects**: Rules referencing dynamic objects (e.g., "Office365 Services") require the target Management server to have an active DNS configuration and internet access to populate its local database. This is a system connectivity requirement, not an API limitation.

## Field Stability
- **Internal Whitelisting**: Complex objects (access-role, simple-gateway, vpn-community-*) contain internal and read-only fields that cause import failures if passed directly to an `add` command. The exporter maintains a curated whitelist to ensure cross-version import stability.
