# Check Point API Exporter - Current Limitations

This list reflects the current state of the exporter. Many previous limitations (like Cleanup rule export and TCP service fields) have been addressed in recent cycles.

## 🚀 Recently Resolved (Cycle 1-5 Improvements)
- **Cleanup Rule Export**: Now fully supported. The exporter intelligently uses `set` if the layer already has a default rule enabled, and `add` otherwise. It also enforces `track Log` by default.
- **TCP Service Fields**: Fields like `delayed-sync-value`, `enable-tcp-resource`, and `use-delayed-sync` are now fully supported via dynamic API spec discovery.
- **VPN Parameters**: `shared-secret` nesting is now correctly handled for CLI imports.
- **Topology Filtering**: Refined to target auto-generated `Net_X.X.X.X` objects while preserving user-created ones.

## ⚠️ Current Object Constraints
- **Application Control**: `application-site` may miss the `primary-category` field depending on the source API version's spec visibility.
- **Whitelisted Fields**: Certain complex objects (`access-role`, `simple-gateway`, `vpn-community-*`) are exported with a curated list of fields to ensure import stability on diverse target environments.
- **Ansible Mappings**: The API uses `remote-access-client` (singular), but Ansible expects `remote-access-clients` (plural).

## 🔒 Access Rule Limitations
- **Advanced Parameters**: `vpn` and `content` (Content Awareness) settings are currently not exported.
- **Rule Names**: Having a rule named "Management" can still cause issues with the `cp_mgmt_access_rule` Ansible module.
- **Updatable Objects**: Rules using objects like "Office365 Services" require the target Management server to have internet access and an updated Updatable Objects database for the import to succeed.

## 💡 Best Practices
- **Parallel Import**: If importing via Ansible, use a loop to import tasks in sequence for better dependency management.
- **CLI Import**: For largest policies, the generated `import_mgmt_cli.txt` is the most robust method as it bypasses Ansible-specific module overhead.
